OpenBlocks refactoring branch
=============================

This is a fork of [MIT OpenBlocks](http://education.mit.edu/drupal/openblocks)
(covered by the MIT license) for refactoring purposes.

The principal objective of the fork is to make the code more amenable to inclusion to other projects.

Getting Started:
------
	$ mvn validate
	$ mvn clean package

	$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="edu.mit.blocks.controller.WorkspaceController" -Dexec.args="support/lang_def.xml"

To do:
------

* upgrade code maintainability from the academic baseline to the commercial baseline
* replace static singletons with contexts and instances

Done:
-----

* move the various project packages from the main namespace to under the ``edu.mit.blocks`` package
* refactor out functionality such as network communication
* remove dependency to TableLayout, which doesn't appear to be actively maintained,
  and really not even used in a very complex manner
